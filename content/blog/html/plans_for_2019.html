<h2 id="spanclassc48whatwedidthisyearspan"><span class="c48">What we did this year</span></h2>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>In 2018, our priority was</span> <span>our own capacity building</span><span> and learning about how to do good research. We completed a deep dive into</span> <span class="c22"><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/">the cost-effectiveness of vaccines</a></span><span> and</span> <span class="c22"><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1pk/lessons_for_estimating_costeffectiveness_of/">learned some lessons</a></span><span> about applying cost-effectiveness estimations to domains with high uncertainty. We launched the</span> <span class="c22"><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1q6/announcing_prioritywiki_a_cause_prioritization/">PriorityWiki</a></span><span> (and</span> <span class="c22"><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90209551/this-website-works-to-decide-which-global-issues-need-fixing-first">got some press</a></span><span>) to help summarize existing prioritization research.</span> <span>We also finished a large hiring round</span><span class="c0">, hiring seven researchers and creating our research agenda for 2019.</span></p>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>We also spent some time analyzing movement building strategy in cooperation with other projects of Rethink Charity. We</span> <span>ran the EA Survey</span><span> and published some of our findings across five posts (e.g.,</span> <span class="c22"><a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SnE9FpArs2uXJsRtB/ea-survey-2018-series-donation-data">see this one on donation data</a></span><span class="c0">) and expect to finish publishing one more post by the end of the year.</span></p>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>Our 2018 research was mostly (though not exclusively) focused on farmed and wild animal welfare. We commissioned</span> <span class="c22"><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1kz/what_is_animal_farming_in_rural_zambia_like_a/">a site visit of farming practices in rural Zambia</a></span><span>,</span><span> we</span> <span class="c22"><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1pn/animal_equality_showed_that_advocating_for_diet/">re-analyzed veg outreach studies,</a></span><span> and</span><span> </span><span>we</span> <span>collaborated with</span> <span>Animal Charity Evaluators on a detailed report on farmed fish welfare</span><span class="c0"> (publication forthcoming).</span></p>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>Finally, we spent a</span> <span>significant amount of time doing thorough research into the invertebrate sentience (following</span> <span class="c22"><a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood">Muehlhauser, 2017</a></span><span>, Section 3.2</span><span>)</span><span>, summarizing the academic literature across 15+ kinds of animals and 40+ potentially conscious indicating features,</span><span> with publications expected in early 2019.</span></p>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>At the start of the year and of the project, the staff of Rethink Priorities consisted only of Peter and Marcus.</span><span> </span><span>We made an internal hire with David Moss and then decided to start a hiring round to expand the team to include more researchers</span><span>.</span><span> Our current team is:</span></p>

<h2 id="span2019researchagendaspan"><span>2019 Research Agenda</span></h2>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>With our team, we are</span> <span>well positioned for 2019</span> <span>to produce substantial amount of</span> <span>high-quality research on a number of topics</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>We intend to continue our focus on farmed and wild animal welfare for 2019, as we still see animal welfare as an important, neglected, and uniquely tractable issue that our team is well-poised to addre</span><span>ss.</span> <span>However, in 2019, we’d also like to allocate some amount of time to working outside animal welfare, such as improving mental health,</span> <span>strengthen</span><span>ing</span><span> the effective altruism movement, reducing catastrophic risks to the survival of humanity (e.g., nuclear weapons, bio-terror, artificial intelligence), and improving the quality of the long-term future.</span></p>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>Projects we may take on in 2019 potentially include:<br />
</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="c1"><strong>Analysis of the impact of ballot initiatives for animal welfare</strong></span><span class="c1"> </span><span>- Ballot initiatives to improve animal welfare have racked up recent wins, such as</span> <span class="c22"><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Minimum_Size_Requirements_for_Farm_Animal_Containment,_Question_3_(2016)">Massachusetts’s Question 3 (2016)</a> and</span> <span class="c22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_California_Proposition_2">California’s Proposition 12 (2018)</a></span><span>, as well as</span> <span class="c22"><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_12,_Farm_Animal_Confinement_Initiative_(2018)">California’s Proposition 2 (2008)</a></span><span>. We’re going to explore the cost-effectiveness of these results both qualitatively and with quantitative econometric models.</span> <span>We’</span><span>ll</span><span class="c0"> these models to identify the most promising future opportunities, which could help identify good funding opportunities for the 2020 election.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="c1"><strong>Analysis of the impact of corporate campaigns in animal welfare</strong></span> <span>- Corporate campaigning is one of the most well-funded and well-regarded animal welfare interventions currently pursued by the effectiveness-oriented animal welfare advocacy community. We’</span><span>ll analyze the cost-effectiveness of corporate campaigning</span> <span class="c0">in more depth as well as understand potential failure modes and how to combat them.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="c1"><strong>Identifying ways to improve wild animal welfare</strong></span> <span>- Wild animal welfare seems very important, as there are vastly many animals in the wild and their lives plausibly contain a lot of suffering. Wild animal lives are also transformed by humans every day with little regard to their welfare. We intend to learn more about what wild animal lives are like and what interventions could help improve their welfare.</span> <span>We</span><span> plan</span><span class="c0"> to use focus groups and surveys to better understand how the public thinks about wild animals.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="c1"><strong>Do</span><span class="c1">ing</span><span class="c1"> surveys and polling</strong></span> <span>- We think better understanding public attitudes could be key to identifying and understanding effective behavioral or policy change.</span> <span>We</span><span> plan</span><span> to run multiple surveys</span><span>, such as analyzing reasons people become vegetarian to better understand the potential for individual diet change, understanding public interest (if any) in banning slaughterhouses (following up</span> <span class="c22"><a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017">Sentience Institute (2017)</a></span><span>). We’d also r</span><span>un polls to identify popular, cost-effective policies</span><span> that could potentially be implemented via ballot measures or lobbying governments (</span><span>we’ve identified a pollster who may collaborate with us quite inexpensively</span><span>). Lastly, we’d like to u</span><span>nderstand how EAs think about ethics, collaborating with EA Foundation</span><span>on their</span> <span class="c22"><a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CmNBmSf6xtMyYhvcs/descriptive-population-ethics-and-its-relevance-for-cause">descriptive ethics research</a></span><span>.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="c1"><strong>Understand</span><span class="c1">ing</span><span class="c1"> EA movement growth</strong></span> <span>- We’d like to run the EA Survey again in 2019.</span><span> We also will continue collaborating with the Local Effective Altruism Network, a fellow project of Rethink Charity, in understanding the effectiveness of current movement building initiatives and what makes movement building initiatives more successful.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="c1"><strong>Understanding mental health</span><span class="c1"> interventions</strong></span> <span>- We’d like to understand if we can rely on</span> <span>$/DALY</span><span> or $/QALY metrics</span><span> to capture mental health benefits or, if not, if there is a better cost-effectiveness metric that better captures mental health benefits.</span><span class="c0"> Once we have a good framework for prioritizing mental health, we’d like to see if we can identify any mental health opportunities that are competitive with other EA opportunities.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="c1"><strong>Analysis of</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c1">c</span><span class="c1">atastrophic</span> <span class="c1">r</span><span class="c1">isk</span> <span class="c1">r</span><span class="c1">eduction</strong></span> <span>- We’d like to start learning how to do work in th</span><span>e</span><span>s</span><span>e</span><span> area</span><span>s</span><span>. We’re intending to start with shallow review</span><span>s</span><span> on</span> <span>organizations dedicated to nuclear de-proliferation</span><span>. We’d also like to see if we can apply insurance risk forecasting</span> <span>techniques</span> <span class="c0">to inform estimates of catastrophic risk.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>While this list is not meant to be a definitive look at which projects we will actually complete in 2019, it represents our broad priorities. As such, our work will span multiple domains, but we intend to focus the majority of our time on animal welfare</span><span>.</span><span class="c0"> </span></p>

<h2 id="span"><span></h2>

<h2 id="spanspan2019spanspangoalsandmeasuringprogressspanspan"></span><span>2019</span> <span>Goals and Measuring Progress</span><span></h2>

<p></span><span class="c26">We see our primary means of impact as influencing and informing the effective altruism movement. Our 2019 goal is to establish ourselves as an effective altruism research organization with a path toward influencing key donors and decision-makers, especially in the animal advocacy space. While the hope is that research we do may uncover important interventions that could absorb millions of dollars in funding, we’d like to start in 2019 simply by ensuring that at least four people or institutions grantin</span><span class="c26">g</span> <span class="c26">at least $50,000 in 2019 each cite our research as a factor in their decision-making. We also</span> <span class="c26">intend to annually run a formal survey to discover if our target audience of large-scale donors has read our work and if it has influenced their decision-making.</span><span class="c26"></p>

<p></span><span></p>

<h2 id="spanspanclassc29c33c38fundraisingspan"></span><span class="c29 c33 c38">Fundraising</span></h2>

<p>Of course, we can’t do this without money! Our 2019 budget is ~$447K:</p>

<p><img src="/img/budget_2019.png"><br></p>

<p><span>But thanks to generous funders, so far we’ve already raised ~$153K, thus making our funding needs ~$294K for 2019:</span></p>

<p><img src="/img/funding_so_far_2019.png"><br></p>

<h2 id="spanfungibilityspan"><span>Fungibility</span></h2>

<p><span>While we are a project of</span> <span class="c22"><a href="https://rtcharity.org/">Rethink Charity</a></span><span>, we maintain an entirely separate budget and fundraise separately. All funding specifically earmarked to Rethink Priorities will be used for Rethink Priorities research only and will not</span> <span>be used</span><span class="c0"> for other Rethink Charity projects.</span></p>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p><span>Furthermore, w</span><span>e’re able to accept funding earmarked to a particular project area (for example, if you only want to fund work into wild animal welfare</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>W</span><span class="c0">e’ve done careful accounting to create budgets for each project and to minimize risk of fungibility between projects. However, unrestricted funding would be most valuable to us to allow us to pursue our highest priority research agendas or change our research plans if we find more important projects.</span></p>

<p><span class="c0"></span></p>

<h2 id="spanclassc29c33c38conclusionspan"><span class="c29 c33 c38">Conclusion</span></h2>

<p><span>We’re excited by our new team and our ambitious research agenda for 2019</span><span>.</span><span> To fund this, we’re looking to raise $294K and we hope that you will consider supporting us.</span><span> Cause prioritization research is valuable and widely neglected. Rethink Priorities is uniquely-placed to make a tractable impact on difficult problems.</span></p>
