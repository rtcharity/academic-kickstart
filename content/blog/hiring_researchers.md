We're excited to announce we are looking to hire junior and senior researchers. We think our research is well-placed to make a difference and we’re looking for part-time and full-time researchers to help us do new research to dramatically improve this impact throughout the effective altruism movement.

If you're interested we'd strongly encourage you to apply by sending in a resume and one example of your best previous research work to [marcus@rtcharity.org](mailto:marcus@rtcharity.org). Feel free to also send me any questions you may have about the given role. Also, for applications, please send with your resume no more than one page explaining what you like, what you dislike, and how you would improve/expand the following research piece: [“Thoughts on the Reducetarian Labs MTurk Study”](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14g/thoughts_on_the_reducetarian_labs_mturk_study/).

Successful applicants based on this first stage will be contacted for the remainder of the application process, which includes spending three hours completing a test task and about 60mins each completing two interviews. That’s it!
