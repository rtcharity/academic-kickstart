The effective altruism movement is allocating hundreds of millions of dollars and millions of person hours to improve the world. Better research can dramatically improve this allocation. [Rethink Priorities](http://rethinkpriorities.org/) is a research organization aimed at uncovering the actionable insights across different EA causes that are needed to do this. We have [founding values](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1ld/announcing_rethink_priorities/) -- we care about transparency, tractability, short feedback loops, actionability, and impact assessment.



So far we’ve done a deep dive on [the cost-effectiveness of vaccines](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/) and [learned some lessons](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1pk/lessons_for_estimating_costeffectiveness_of/), we’ve launched the [PriorityWiki](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1q6/announcing_prioritywiki_a_cause_prioritization/) (and [got some press](https://www.fastcompany.com/90209551/this-website-works-to-decide-which-global-issues-need-fixing-first)!), we’ve commissioned [a site visit of farming practices in rural Zambia](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1kz/what_is_animal_farming_in_rural_zambia_like_a/), and we’ve looked at [re-analyzing veg outreach studies](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1pn/animal_equality_showed_that_advocating_for_diet/).
