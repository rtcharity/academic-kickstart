      <title>Detecting Morally Significant Pain in Nonhumans: Some Philosophical Difficulties</title>

      <description>This essay is a project was written by Jason Schukraft, with contributions from Peter Hurford, Max Carpendale, and Marcus A. Davis.
Other humans merit moral concern. We think many nonhumans merit moral concern too. But how do we know? And which nonhumans? Chimpanzees? Chickens? Bumblebees? Protozoa? Roombas? Rocks? Where and how do we draw a line?
What would it take to justifiably believe that some nonhuman experiences pain (or pleasure) in a morally significant way?</description>

      <description>The effective altruism movement is allocating hundreds of millions of dollars and millions of person hours per year to improve the world.Rethink Prioritiesis a research organization aimed at uncovering actionable insights across different EA causes, improving the effectiveness of this time and money. We’re guided by our founding values– we care about transparency, tractability, short feedback loops, actionability, and impact assessment. Rethink Priorities is an independent project of Rethink Charity, founded in January 2018 by Peter Hurford and Marcus A.</description>

      <title>Announcing PriorityWiki: A Cause Prioritization Wiki</title>
      <link>https://rtcharity.github.io/rethink-priorities/blog/announcing_prioritywiki/</link>

      <description>This essay was jointly written by Peter Hurford and Marcus A. Davis.
Locating and keeping up to date on all of the information in all every cause worthy of attention is time-consuming work, and a task we think is likely to be duplicated many times over by individuals and organizations. It’s very useful when deciding what interventions to spend your time or money on to know what work has already been done in the area.</description>

      <title>Animal Equality showed that advocating for diet change works. But is it cost-effective?</title>

      <description>This essay was jointly written by Peter Hurford and Marcus A. Davis. All code for analyses contained is available on GitHub.
Summary: Animal Equality and Faunalytics put together a field study testing individual video outreach on belief and diet change. They found statistically significant results on both. Together with the Reducetarian study, we now think there is sufficient evidence to establish that individual outreach may work to produce positive change for nonhuman animals.</description>

      <title>Lessons for estimating cost-effectiveness (of vaccines) more effectively</title>
      <link>https://rtcharity.github.io/rethink-priorities/blog/lessons_learned_vaccines/</link>

      <description>This essay was jointly written by Peter Hurford and Marcus A. Davis.
Summary: We investigated the cost-effectiveness of vaccine research and development to learn about how cost-effectiveness estimates are made and where they might go wrong. By doing this, we became far more wary of taking these estimates literally. Many people will do things like reducing their cost-effectiveness estimate by a factor of 10x and call this a conservative estimate, but in light of this exercise and other examples, this is not enough.</description>

      <title>What is the cost-effectiveness of developing a vaccine?</title>
      <link>https://rtcharity.github.io/rethink-priorities/blog/cost-effectiveness_of_developing_a_vaccine/</link>

      <description>This essay was jointly written by Peter Hurford and Marcus A. Davis.
Summary: We looked at academic literature for vaccine cost-effectiveness as a whole and we also performed individual case studies on seven contemporary and historical vaccines to try to estimate the total cost-effectiveness of researching and developing a vaccine from scratch. Looking back historically, we find a range of $0.50 to $1600 per DALY, depending on the vaccine. Using this historical information, we derive an estimate for the total cost-effectiveness of developing and rolling out a “typical” / ”average” vaccine as being $18 - $7000 / DALY.</description>

      <title>How beneficial have vaccines been?</title>

      <description>Previously we estimated how expensive it is to research and develop a vaccine and also how expensive it is to roll-out a vaccine. If vaccines are to be cost-effective, we need to realise significant benefits in return for this expenditure. So let’s take a closer look at the specific and tangible benefits that vaccines have shown to provide, both for our health and the economy. Simply put, the benefits to society brought about by vaccines can be categorised into two main types, health benefits and economic benefits, illustrated by the following equation: Total vaccine benefits = Health benefits + Economic benefits</description>

      <title>How much does it cost to roll-out a vaccine?</title>
      <link>https://rtcharity.github.io/rethink-priorities/blog/how_much_does_it_cost_to_roll-out_vaccine/</link>

      <description>We previously estimated the cost of developing a vaccine from scratch to be $460M to $1.9B with a mean of $960M. However, this still does not tell us the full cost of a vaccine, because developing a vaccine but then not ever using it accomplishes nothing. Instead, you need to roll out the vaccine to people, which costs more money. Thus, vaccine R&amp;amp;D could be thought of as “unlocking” the opportunity to roll-out a vaccine, and the hope is that the high cost-effectiveness of rolling out a vaccine will help offset the high cost of vaccine R&amp;amp;D.</description>

      <title>How much does it cost to research and develop a vaccine?</title>

      <description>Previously, we estimated how long it takes to research and develop a vaccine and came up with a conclusion that it would take “an average of 29 years [to develop a] typical vaccine, though with high uncertainty based on uncertainties in each approach and on many particular vaccines not being typical”. However, if we want to know the cost-effectiveness of vaccine research, it’s not enough to know how long a vaccine takes, but how much total money it would cost.</description>

      <title>What is Animal Farming in Rural Zambia Like? A Site Visit</title>
      <link>https://rtcharity.github.io/rethink-priorities/blog/animal_farming_rural_zambia/</link>

      <description>Factory farming in the United States and other developed countries is no doubt terrible. And while other developing countries are catching up in their sophistication, it is not clear yet what factory farming is like in the least developed parts of the developing world where most aid is focused. Instead, most rural livestock in the developing world is kept in a pastoral farming system that is relatively “free range”. However, little information is publicly available on the internet about what this is like or how much animal suffering is involved relative to the developed country horror of factory farming.</description>

      <description>Interventions related to vaccines seem to be highly cost-effective. The World Health Organization calls vaccines “one of the most powerful and cost-effective of all health interventions.&amp;rdquo; (WHO, 2009, pXIV) and the Copenhagen Consensus says that &amp;ldquo;[v]accination may be the most effective public health intervention of all time” (Copenhagen Consensus Center Guide to Giving 2011, p37). GiveWell finds vaccine-related interventions to be highly cost-effective and have recommended one-off donations to vaccines on multiple occasions 1 through Incubation Grants.</description>
